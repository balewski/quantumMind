1a) -  Hadamard Test for 1 qubit state vector.
 Input:
  |x> is random 1-qubit state
  U is one of Pauli 3 matrices : x,y,z
 Output: 
    Re (  <x|U|x> )
    Im (  <x|U|x> )

1b) -  Hadamard Test for multi qubit state vector.
 Input:
  |x> is random m-qubit state
  U is tensor product of all possible m-permutations of  Pauli matrices
  E.g. for M=2 qubits: U={ xx,xy,xz,yx,yy,yz,zx,zy,zz }

 Output: 
    Re (  <psi|U|psi> )

1c) -  Hadamard Test for multi qubit, shot based analysis.
 Input:
  |x> is random m-qubit state
  U is tensor product of all possible m-permutations of  Pauli matrices

1d) - Hadamard Test using  VQLS ansatz for multi qubit shot-based analysis.
 can use FakeLime backend
 VQLS ansatz is optimal for linear connectivity 

 Input:
  |psi> is random m-qubit state  defined by  VQLS ansatz
  use hardware-efficient layered ansatz from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05820.pdf

  U is tensor product of all possible m-permutations of  Pauli matrices

  E.g. for M=2 qubits: U={ xx,xy,xz,yx,yy,yz,zx,zy,zz }

 Output: 
    Re (  <psi|U|psi> )

2a) -  Hadamard-overlap Test for 1 qubit state vector.
 Input:
  |a> is random 1-qubit state
  |b> is another random 1-qubit state
  
  A,B are one of Pauli 3 matrices : x,y,z
 Output: 
    Re (  <a|A|a>*<b|B|b> )


= = = = = 
2b) -  Hadamard-overlap Test for multi qubit state vector.
 Input:
   |a> is random m-qubit state
   |b> is another random m-qubit state

  A,B are seqence  Pauli 3 matrices : 1,x,y,z, with identity on all other qubits
  E.g. for M=2 qubits: Av=[xI,Iy], len(Av)=M
  This is used by the  'local cost function'  which is more robust to barren plateaus

   A single execution of Hadamard-overlap computes:  Re (  <a|A|a>*<b|B|b> )

  The main code selects a speciffic order of 3*m Paulis, the same for A & B
  E.g. for m=3
  Av=[ x11,y11,z11, 1x1,1y1,1z1, 11x,11y,11z]
  bv=Av

  next it computes the vector of products, len(Ov)=3*m  , '3' because paulis have 3 falvores
  Ov= [ Re (  <a|Ai|a>*<b|Bi|b> ) ]

2c) -  Hadamard-overlap Test for multi qubit, shot based analysis.
 Input:
   |a> is random m-qubit state
   |b> is another random m-qubit state
 ...all the same as for 2b)
