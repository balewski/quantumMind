 - simu coin heads for coin A,B
 - compute log-likelihood ratio score
 - repat and do histogram vs. p-value


Formulas:

Let N - number of trails,
H - number of heads
p - true  probability of heads
ps = H/N   - estimated probability fo heads

bias of composite estimator:  Hab=Ha+Hb, psab=Hab/Nab

log-likelihood of measuring H heads given N trials is given by the formula:
LogL(H,N)= ln[ ps^H * (1-ps)^(N-H) ] =
     H*ln(H) - N*ln(N) + (N-H)*ln(N-H)

Likelihood Ratio Test:
for a pair of coins A,B   score is defined as
  score= -2 *( LogL(A+B) -  LogL(A) - LogL(B) )

if H0: p_A==p_B (coins are identical) then score has chi2(dof=1) distribution
One can compute p=value of H0


p-value is given by 
scipy.stats.chi2.cdf(Score,k=1.)
