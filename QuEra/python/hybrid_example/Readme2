More cumbersome 
 example of packaging of a hybrid job which run on Quera or AWS simulator

The main macro is hybrid_submit.py

The whole task code is in sub-dir
task_code/  main2_task.py  toolbox

The main difference vs. main1_task.py & Readme1 is:

* a handfull of hyperparams set in hybrid_submit2.py will be passed to main_task:execute_task()  as run-time arguments and are accessed  NOT in main but in the function

and it stopped working ????
