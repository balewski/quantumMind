Summary:
This is an instruction on how to build and use a Podman image.
The example consists of three parts:
A) Building the image, which I've already completed on PM.
B) Running the image on PM in three modes: simple interactive, advanced interactive, and a Slurm job that executes your code inside a podman image.
C) Running the same image on your laptop. You'll need to build it as described in A), but then running it is straightforward.

Dockerfile:  https://bitbucket.org/balewski/jannersc/src/master/dockerVaria/ubuntu/Dockerfile.ubu22-PennyLane
Laptop: 
    podman build -f Dockerfile.ubu22-PennyLane -t balewski/ubu22-pennylane:p3   .
Perlmutter
   podman-hpc build -f Dockerfile.ubu22-PennyLane -t balewski/ubu22-pennylane:p3   .
   podman-hpc migrate   balewski/ubu22-pennylane:p3 
   Note, image can't be overwritten, always advance the :version #

B.1  - - - - - -  simple interactive use  on a worker node - - - - - - - 

ssh perlmutter
cd  $SCRATCH/tmp
salloc -q interactive -C cpu -t 4:00:00 -A nstaff
podman-hpc run -it  balewski/ubu22-pennylane:p3 bash
 python3 -c 'import pennylane'
exit


B.2  - - - - - -  advanced interactive use  on a worker node - - - - - - - 
copy & customize  https://github.com/balewski/quantumMind/blob/main/PennyLane/pm_podman.source   
to configure shortcuts to your liking

ssh perlmutter
salloc -q interactive -C cpu -t 4:00:00 -A nstaff
source pm_podman.source 

[ do your work ]

exit  #from podman
exit # from salloc



B.3  - - - - - -  advanced : Slurm job with multiple task  using Podman image- - - - - - - 
  copy and customize https://github.com/balewski/quantumMind/tree/main/PennyLane/qml_intro/
batchPodman.slr
wrap_podman.sh
 
You will edit code stored  in CFS area but running job will read/write from/to SCRATCH using its copy.  Do NOT start Podman image manually

ssh perlmutter
ssh CFS  (to your area )
sbatch batchPodman.slr

$ podman run -it  balewski/ubu22-pennylane:p3 bash

copy & customize  https://github.com/balewski/quantumMind/blob/main/PennyLane/laptop_podman.source 
to configure shortcuts to your liking

source laptop_podman.source 

[ do your work ]

exit  #from podman

If you need to reset podman, do :   source restart_podman.source


C.4  - - - - - -  advanced : jupiter notebook on the laptop powered by Podman PennyLane image running on the laptop - - - - - - - 

source laptop_podman.source jnb 
(exec inside running image)  jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root --port  8833 
copy http  string and paste into local browser , e.g:   http://127.0.0.1:8833/tree?token=7c5cdf5e5c4f1a9d2a616a739988132d59f1a7ca3f4c0779

Troubleshooting: if JNB remains blank change port ID in  laptop_podman.source  and restart the image
