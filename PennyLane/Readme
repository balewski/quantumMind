Summary:
This is an instruction on how to build and use a Podman image. It consists of 3 parts:
A)  building of the image, I have done it already on PM
B) running image on PM in 3 ways:  simple interactive, advanced interactive, and run Slurm job which executes your code inside podman image
C) running the same image on your laptop (you need to build it following A), then run is simple and advanced way

Dockerfile:  https://bitbucket.org/balewski/jannersc/src/master/dockerVaria/ubuntu/Dockerfile.ubu22-PennyLane
Laptop: 
    podman build -f Dockerfile.ubu22-PennyLane -t balewski/ubu22-pennylane:p3   .
Perlmutter
   podman-hpc build -f Dockerfile.ubu22-PennyLane -t balewski/ubu22-pennylane:p3   .
   podman-hpc migrate   balewski/ubu22-pennylane:p3 
   Note, image can't be overwritten, always advance the :version #

B.1  - - - - - -  simple interactive use  on a worker node - - - - - - - 

ssh perlmutter
cd  $SCRATCH/tmp
salloc -q interactive -C cpu -t 4:00:00 -A nstaff
podman-hpc run -it  balewski/ubu22-pennylane:p3 bash
 python3 -c 'import pennylane'
exit


B.2  - - - - - -  advanced interactive use  on a worker node - - - - - - - 
copy & customize  https://github.com/balewski/quantumMind/blob/main/PennyLane/pm_podman.source   
to configure shortcuts to your liking

ssh perlmutter
salloc -q interactive -C cpu -t 4:00:00 -A nstaff
source pm_podman.source 

[ do your work ]

exit  #from podman
exit # from salloc



B.3  - - - - - -  advanced : Slurm job with multiple task  using Podman image- - - - - - - 
  copy and customize https://github.com/balewski/quantumMind/tree/main/PennyLane/qml_intro/
batchPodman.slr
wrap_podman.sh
 
You will edit code stored  in CFS area but running job will read/write to SCRATCH using its copy.  Do NOT start Podman image manually

ssh perlmutter
ssh CFS  (to your area )
sbatch batchPodman.slr


B.4  - - - - - -  advanced : jupiter notebook on the laptop powered by Podman PennyLane image running on PM - - - - - - - 
  Easy to do

$ podman run -it  balewski/ubu22-pennylane:p3 bash
 python3 -c 'import pennylane'
exit


C.2  - - - - - -  advanced w/ predefined volume mounts on a laptop  - - - - - - - 
copy & customize  https://github.com/balewski/quantumMind/blob/main/PennyLane/laptop_podman.source 
to configure shortcuts to your liking

source laptop_podman.source 

[ do your work ]

exit  #from podman

If you need to reset podman, do :   source restart_podman.source


C.4  - - - - - -  advanced : jupiter notebook on the laptop powered by Podman PennyLane image running on the laptop - - - - - - - 

source laptop_podman.source jnb 
(exec inside running image)  jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root --port  8833 
copy http  string and paste into local browser , e.g:   http://127.0.0.1:8833/tree?token=7c5cdf5e5c4f1a9d2a616a739988132d59f1a7ca3f4c0779

Troubleshooting: if JNB remains blank change port ID in  laptop_podman.source  and restart the image
