JAXopt provides a broader suite of optimization algorithms, including support for non-differentiable problems and constrained optimization.


Optax focuses specifically on gradient-based optimization with a strong emphasis on composability and customizability, making it particularly suited for deep learning applications.

If you are working on quantum machine learning projects or hybrid models that involve quantum circuits, PennyLane's NesterovMomentumOptimizer offers a direct way to integrate classical optimization techniques within your quantum computing workflows.

NesterovMomentumOptimizer from PennyLane, like other gradient-based optimization algorithms, fundamentally relies on the ability to compute gradients of the objective function with respect to its parameters.
