1. Robust Quantinuum & Guppy Stack
Guppy (0.21.8): The latest version of the Quantinuum Guppy compiler.
Quantum Nexus (qnexus): Full integration for job submission and retrieval.
Tket 2 Engine: The new Rust-based compiler backend (tket) built from source during the image creation.

2. Full Visualization Support (Plotting)
Unlike previous ARM versions, this image includes the real tket library rather than a mock.
Includes libclang-dev and a custom Conan 2.x wrapper, which was the "magic fix" needed to let the Rust build toolchain correctly link the C++ components for circuit plotting.
Supports converting HUGR/GUGR data to standard pytket circuits for HTML or Mermaid visualization.

3. Native ARM64 Optimization
Rust Toolchain Integrated: Fully configured with rustup to manage native builds for M-series Macs.
Conan 2.0+: Configured with an optimized ARM v8 profile for modern GCC 13/14 compatibility.
OpenMP Support: Includes libgomp1 for parallel execution of emulators/simulators.

4. Comprehensive Environment
Base: Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat).
Python 3.12 Virtual Env: Located at /opt/venv, isolated but fully configured with global symlinks for critical tools (like Conan).
Math/Scientific Tools: numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and networkx.
Status Check: It is currently finishing the Installing Build Dependencies phase for the final python packages. Once done, you’ll be able to run 
retrieve_circuit.py
 natively on your laptop and see the actual quantum gate plots from Guppy jobs.
